## How Faciaro works

- Picture of a user will be taken with full user permission.
- The picture will be passed through a Microsoft Cognitive Services API which can predict an accurate emotional state of the user.
- Based on the predictions, a song will be chosen from the backend database.
- The song will then be presented to the user to be played on Spotify.
